# Coffee Blockchain Smart Contract

This repository contains a smart contract deployed on the Solana blockchain for managing coffee-related transactions. The smart contract facilitates the buying, selling, and tracking of coffee using blockchain technology.

## Features

- **Decentralized Transactions**: Enable peer-to-peer transactions of coffee beans or products without relying on intermediaries.
- **Transparency**: Utilize the transparent nature of blockchain to provide visibility into the coffee supply chain from production to consumption.
- **Immutability**: Once recorded on the blockchain, transactions cannot be altered or tampered with, ensuring data integrity.
- **Efficiency**: Conduct transactions quickly and securely on the Solana blockchain, benefiting from its high throughput and low transaction fees.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/installation)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Deployment

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coffee-smart-contract.git
   cd coffee-smart-contract
   ```

2. Build the smart contract:

   ```bash
   cargo build-bpf
   ```

3. Deploy the smart contract:

   ```bash
   solana program deploy target/deploy/coffee_smart_contract.so
   ```

### Interacting with the Smart Contract

You can interact with the deployed smart contract using Solana CLI, or by integrating it into your application using Solana SDK.

Example transaction:

```bash
solana transfer <receiver_address> <amount> --from <sender_address> --fee-payer <fee_payer_address>
```

Replace placeholders with appropriate addresses and amounts.
